### Exercise: Setting Up Your Development Environment

In a production environment, you would typically create a customer-managed policy in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for precise control over your policies. This policy would then be attached to a new user, and you would log in to the AWS Management Console with that user. However, because you are working in an exercise environment, those steps were omitted.

#### Task 1: Creating an AWS Cloud9 Environment and Downloading the Application

1. Choose Services and search for Cloud9 in the Oregon (US-West-2) Region.
2. Create an environment named "trivia-app."
3. Download the application using the following commands:

```shell
wget https://aws-tc-largeobjects.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/DEV-AWS-MO-DevOps-C1/downloads/trivia-app.zip -O ~/trivia-app.zip
unzip -o ~/trivia-app.zip
```

#### Task 2: Creating the Backend Infrastructure

1. In the trivia-app folder, use AWS SAM to build the template.yaml file:

```shell
cd trivia-app
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```

2. During the SAM guided deployment:
   - For Stack Name, enter "trivia-app."
   - For AWS Region, press Enter.
   - Confirm changes before deploy, press Enter.
   - Allow SAM CLI IAM role creation, press Enter.
   - Save arguments to configuration file, press Enter.

You should receive confirmation that the stack was created successfully.

3. Copy the Websocket Value from the Outputs table in the terminal output.

#### Task 3: Testing the Frontend on AWS Cloud9

1. Update the trivia-app/front-end-react/src/config.js file with the Websocket endpoint.
2. Set the Node version to v16 (codename: Gallium):

```shell
nvm install lts/gallium
nvm alias default lts/gallium
```

3. Change to the front-end-react directory and install NPM dependencies:

```shell
cd front-end-react/
npm install
npm run start
```

4. Preview the application in the AWS Cloud9 environment.

#### Task 4: Deploying the Frontend to an S3 Bucket

1. Create a uniquely named Amazon S3 bucket:

```shell
aws s3 mb s3://<your_initials><numbers>-trivia-app-bucket/
npm run build
aws s3 sync --acl public-read build s3://<your_initials><numbers>-trivia-app-bucket/
```

2. View the application hosted on your bucket using the URL, which should look like:

```
https://<your_initials><numbers>-trivia-app-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
```

#### Task 5: Putting the Application Under Source Control

1. Choose AWS Cloud9 > Go To Your Dashboard in the menu bar.
2. Search for CodeCommit in Services and create a repository named "trivia-app."
3. Configure Git with your name and email address:

```shell
git config --global user.name "<REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_NAME>"
git config --global user.email <REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_EMAIL>
```

4. Initialize your repository, create a branch, commit, and push the code:

```shell
cd ~/environment/trivia-app/
git init
git checkout -b main
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git remote add origin codecommit://trivia-app
git push origin main
```

This README provides step-by-step instructions for setting up your development environment, deploying backend and frontend resources, and putting the application under source control.
